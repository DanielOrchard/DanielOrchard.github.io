    Star Citizen's Squadren 42 was a very large project for me, taking place over two years. My role was to drive and manage the realtime visualisation. Since this was (at the time) a CryEngine game, the realtime was all performed in CryEngine, in the actual game client. 
    This allowed our realtime to closely reflect the end-result.

      On the last frontier I created the inital pitchvis in Unreal Engine, which was a complete scene with lighting, motion capture, and characters.
      Later in development I also helped with marketing material, in particular R&D into new mediums of delivery, such as 360 and VR.
