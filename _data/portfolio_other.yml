    <p> The Tempest was a massive project for me where performance capture was merged with traditional stage show control to produce a realtime avatar, driven live on stage, and controlled through external tools over network languages, mainly DMX, OSC, and PSN </p>
    <p> I created the Unreal project and merged all the elements together, including all the state logic, visual changes, and materials and particle fx. </p>
