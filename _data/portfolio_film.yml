      <p> On Game of Thrones (Season 8), I designed and produced virtual production tools, mainly utilising VR, for previsualisation and shot-planning, 
      used for the more complex scenes, the primary tool being <a href="https://pathfinder.thethirdfloorinc.com/" target="_blank"> Pathfinder </a>, 
      which allows you to both both scout locations and to plan camera shots. </p>
      Epic Games has created a excellent write-up of our work which you can read here:

      Mowgli made heavy use of Unreal Engine for both previsualisation and realtime  display of performance capture. 
      I created digital sets, mapped digital avatars to performers, and produce rushes of the shoots. This was performed both in studio and on location.

      For the Ritual I used Unreal Engine to build previs scenes to help plan the capture of more difficult shots, 
      these were then used with performance capture digital sets for character motion development for the digital avatar of the monster (All in Unreal).

    <p> I created a system for placing background npcs into any project, inc mocap import and retargetting, seeded randomised characters, 
    outfits and animations, with a focus to bring the digital sets to life. 
    This system has since been reused in other projects and easily adapted to new use cases. </p>
